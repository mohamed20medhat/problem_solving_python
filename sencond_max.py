# trying to find the max number first 

# sort it as a list then take the largest and the smallest
# the problem with it is that i can't get the second largest element cause i don't know if there are repeated elements in it. if an element was repeated then l[-2] will return the same as l[-1]. so there must be another way
# l = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,1,3,4,2,1]
# l.sort()
# print(l[0]) # min
# print(l[-1]) # max
# # now how to print the second largest number ? 
# print(min(l))
# print(max(l))
